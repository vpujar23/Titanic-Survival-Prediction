# Titanic Survival Prediction: Logistic Regression vs Decision Tree

## Overview
This project, developed for the CS 545 Machine Learning class, delves into the comparative analysis of two prominent machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. Our goal was to predict the survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic, utilizing a well-known dataset that encompasses various passenger attributes. Through meticulous data preprocessing and model implementation, we aimed to assess the accuracy and performance of each algorithm, offering insights into their effectiveness in predicting survival rates.

## Contribution
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Implemented by Simranjit Bhella & Shishir Gururaj
- **Decision Tree Model:** Carried out by Vijayalaxmi Pujar & Bhavani Chanda
- **Testing & Comparison:** Conducted by Syam Prasad Chitluri, who also handled the documentation of the project findings.

## Project Goals
1. To train and evaluate a logistic regression model using the Titanic dataset.
2. To develop and assess a decision tree model on the same dataset.
3. To compare both models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to understand their predictive power in survival prediction scenarios.

## Dataset and Tools
- **Dataset:** The Titanic survival prediction dataset, available on Kaggle, including passenger attributes like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn for model implementation, Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
2. **Model Implementation:** Both logistic regression and decision tree models were implemented and trained using Scikit-Learn.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
4. **Comparison and Analysis:** The performance of both models was compared to identify strengths and weaknesses.

## Results and Findings
- **Logistic Regression:** Showcased superior predictive accuracy, with an accuracy of 87%, precision of 79%, recall of 86%, and an F1-score of 0.83.
- **Decision Tree:** Demonstrated an accuracy of 79%, indicating a robust yet slightly less effective prediction capability compared to logistic regression.
- The comparison underscored logistic regression's higher efficiency in predicting survival outcomes on the Titanic, attributed to its balance of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
Our investigation emphasizes the significance of algorithm selection in machine learning projects. By meticulously evaluating logistic regression and decision tree algorithms, we've provided valuable insights into their applicability for survival prediction tasks, underlining logistic regression's slightly superior performance in this context.
